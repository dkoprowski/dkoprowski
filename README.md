# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel

I'm on a mission to make our world better by sharing knowledge. That is why I created a programming and productivity blog. It is also my technological playground. Also, I use Twitter for a similar reason.

Since 2015 I work professionally with user interfaces. I have experience with user app interaction through a wide range of channels. Like a mouse-clicking, screen touch, Kinect sensor, virtual reality controllers and gamepads. 

In my free time, I like to cook, trekking, play badminton and create big dreams.
