# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel

[![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Koprowski_it)](https://twitter.com/Koprowski_it/)

I'm on a mission to make our world better by sharing knowledge. That is why I created a programming and productivity blog which is my technological playground. Also, I use Twitter for a similar reason.

Since 2015, I work professionally with user interfaces. I have experience with app interaction through a wide range of channels. Like mouse-clicking, screen touch, Kinect sensor, virtual reality controllers, and gamepads. 

In my free time, I like to cook, hike, play badminton, and dream big.
