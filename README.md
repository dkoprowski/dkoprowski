# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

[![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Koprowski_it)](https://twitter.com/Koprowski_it/)

I'm Daniel, a software engineer passionate about enhancing how we interact with technology.

Driven by a mission to make our world better by sharing knowledge, I launched blogs focused on programming and productivity.

Since 2015, I've been coding the bridge between design and functionality, turning visions into interactive experiences and exploring the many ways people interact with apps. Whether through a click, a touch, motion sensing with Kinect, diving into VR, or using gamepads. 

I love making technology more accessible and engaging for everyone. To me, the magic lies in turning great designs into real, usable products that people love.

Beyond technology, my interests include cooking, hiking, playing badminton, and tackling various DIY projects. My blogs, [Koprowski.it](https://www.koprowski.it/) and [Progractivity](https://www.progractivity.com/), are places where I blend my professional insights with personal passions, aiming to share knowledge that not only informs but also inspires.
